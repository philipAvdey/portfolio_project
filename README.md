# My Portfolio Website 
Built with ReactJS, JavaScript, and SCSS. Boostrapped with Vite. This was also my first foray into Sanity, which provides an editing interface for various components. Hosted on Netlify [here](https://philip-avdey.netlify.app/). Just a way for me to display my projects and experience with some stylish UI and UX. Still a work in progress, trying to get it to work with Vite.
